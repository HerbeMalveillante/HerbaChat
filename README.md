# HerbaChat
A socket based chat client for Python.

I started this project to create a basic chat software that could be used in a local network.
It may be very buggy, just let me know if you experience any issue

# How to use : 

1) Launch the server.py script (python 3 compatible).
2) Copy the IP adress and send it to all the people wanting to connect on your local network.
3) Launch the client.py script (python 3 compatible).
4) Enter a username and the IP address. Be careful to not mispell the IP as you won't be able to change it unless you relaunch the program (that's a feature I still need to implement)
5) When the windows opens, hit File > Login to connect to the server. Don't click on this when you're already logged in as it may crash the program. Please note that all others buttons in the top menu won't work. 

You can now type your message in the dedicated field and hit enter to send your message.
Please note that this program is not very advanced and is very buggy.
